# Dunmurgh Character Sheet

To get started playing with the sheet helper, you'll need to clone the repo.

Once you've done that, you'll need [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org), and you'll need to install [yarn](https://yarnpkg.com).

With those things out of the way, navigate to the directory you cloned the repo into and run `yarn install`. This might take a bit.

Finally, you're ready to fire up the sheet helper!  `gulp` will build the sheet, fire up a livereload server and open the sheet helper in your default browser.
